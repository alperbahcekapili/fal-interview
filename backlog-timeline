I got the description of implementing Wan2.2 t2i and i2i. However, Wan2.2 is a video generation model. Using wan2.2 api to generate a single frame video is trivial which should be bare minimum(implementing requirements for serverless). 
I believe going over the architecture of Wan2.2 I can isolate the process of generating single image from the existing functionality at the model. Therefore I start working by reading the paper of Wan2.2
